# Warm Up - Traverse a Linked List and Binary Tree Iteratively

Traversing a Linked List and a Binary Tree are important skills for any software engineer. Traversal involves visiting all nodes possible from a starting point, typically the root node of a tree or head node in a Linked List.

## Overview

Complete the traversal methods on the Linked List and the Binary Tree Classes.  Try to use an iterative appraoch.  Include a way to verify that your method visits all nodes in a Linked List and a Binary Tree.

```javascript

class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value: value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

class BinaryTree {
  constructor() {
    this.root = null;
  }

  traverse() {

  }
}



class ListNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  traverse() {

  }
}


```
